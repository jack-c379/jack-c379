<h3 align="left">👩‍💻  About Me</h3>

###

<p align="left">I build products that solve real business problems and scale reliably. Some of my recent work includes:<br><br>1. Autonomous AI Hotel Receptionist Apps<br>Built and deployed AI agents that handle guest queries with ~90% accuracy, reducing front-desk workload by 40% across 15+ hotels and accelerating check-ins through PMS/booking API integrations.<br><br>2. AI-Powered Geo-Optimised Content Engine<br>Created an automated system that generates and publishes SEO-ready blogs without human intervention, improving organic reach while reducing content ops effort to near zero.<br><br>3. AI-driven Price Fairness Model (Real Estate)<br>Developed a supervised ML model (XGBoost) using 3 years of sales data to score 50k+ listings; improved CTR and listing quality by 11% by surfacing fairly priced properties.<br><br>4. WhatsApp Automation for Lead Gen & Upsell<br>Scaled custom AI-driven WhatsApp flows for recommendations, lead generation, and monetisation—driving ~30% of platform inquiries at ~20% of CAC.<br><br>5. Search & Ads Personalization Systems<br>Improved listing discovery using freshness, behavioral signals, and vendor reputation; paired with new ad formats to optimize monetisation and lead distribution.<br><br>Across these projects, my goal was simple: build AI solutions that work in the real world, achieve fast PMF, and deliver meaningful revenue and efficiency gains.</p>
